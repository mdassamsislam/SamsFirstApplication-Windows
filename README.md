I have downloaded Visual Studio a lot of times but never made any project. This is my first C# (WinForms) Project. It's very simple and staright. Just Take two inputs [Name &amp; Password] and shows the password as given. NSIS was used to make a full package along with icons 😁Very much excited about my first project. So,here I am to store it forever😊
